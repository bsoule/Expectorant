Expectorant is a stochastic, nerdtastic, restaurant bill splitting app and random number spinner.

<h2>How do you use this?</h2>

<p>
<i>Enter a probability</i> (between 0 and 1) or an arithmetic expression that evaluates to a probability and press <i>Expectorize</i>.
</p>

<h2>Typical use case</h2>

<p>
Say you owe me $7 for lunch but only have a twenty.
If you give me the twenty with probability 7/20 then in expectation you've paid me $7!
So type in <b>7/20</b> and spin the spinner.
If it comes up green then I lucked out and get the $20. 
</p>

<p>
Or of course there's what the Soule-Reeveses call pumpkin-patching or skyootling where instead of paying someone the $X you owe them, you pay them 10 times that but with only 1/10 probability.
That's handy for reducing transactional overhead: 90% of the time you don't have to make any money change hands or ledger anything.
It especially saves time if the amount owed hasn't actually been computed yet. 
As long as you <i>can</i> unambiguously compute it if/when the 10% expectorization happens, 90% of the time you don't have to bother.
</p>

<h2>Advanced feature for exact (expected) change</h2>

<p>
Suppose you owe me $7 but only have a five and a twenty.
If you enter 
<b>7@5,20</b>, 
that's a shortcut for 
<b>(7-5)/(20-5)</b>
which is the probability p such that (1-p)*5 + p*20 = 7. 
In other words, it's the exquisitely fair probability p that you should give me the twenty &mdash; giving me the five with probability 1-p &mdash; so that you're giving me exactly $7 in expectation!
</p>

<h2>Stochastic nerdtastic restaurant bill splitting</h2>

<p>
Say the subtotal is $100 and the items on the bill are $5, $25, $60, and $10. 
Enter <b>100:5</b> and have the person who ordered the $5 item spin the spinner.
If it comes up green (a 5% chance) they get to pay the whole bill! 
If not, amend the expression as <b>100:5,25</b> and repeat for the person who got the $25 item. 
They'll "win" with probability 25/(100-5). 
If they're off the hook, amend again to <b>100:5,25,60</b>. 
This time most likely &mdash; p = 60/(100-5-25) &mdash; the $60 person will win the honor of paying the bill. 
If not, notice that <b>100:5,25,60,10</b> yields 10/(100-5-25-60) = 1. 
So if the process makes it to the last item on the bill then whoever got that item is it.
Mathemagically, it doesn't matter what order you put the items in &mdash; each person "wins" (pays the whole bill) with probability equal to their own fair share of the bill.
In other words, you pay in expectation exactly your fair share. 
Including tax and tip, even though we never entered those.
Pretty slick! 
Speaking of tips, you can minimize the hassle by starting with the most expensive items.
Then you don't have to figure out who most of the items belong to.
Oh, and if 3 people split the $10 pickled monkey balls just treat it as 3 items, $10/3 each (expressions instead of numbers are allowed).

Built by Christopher Moravec, Bethany Soule, and Daniel Reeves.
Based on an Android app that Soule and Reeves published in 2010 (!) and that's 
technically still in Google's app store but doesn't work on modern phones.
Thanks to Dave Pennock who invented the restaurant bill-splitting algorithm.
