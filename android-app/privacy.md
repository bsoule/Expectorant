# PRIVACY POLICY EXPECTORANT

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Expectorant (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Bethany Soule. The Application is essentially a random number generator. You pick a number in 1-20 and then give the app a probability (or an arithmetic expression that evaluates to a number between 0 and 1), and the app lights up a subset of the numbers in the grid such that your number will be lit up with the given probability.

This privacy policy is required by the Google Play Store, but to be clear up front, Expectorant collects no data from you or about you. It's just a tool I built for my own use / fun. There is no registration, and no usage analytics, no ads, no marketing, etc.
 
## User Provided Information 

The Application does not require any registration and does not collect or store any information provided by the user either locally on the device or in any external services.
 
## Automatically Collected Information 

The only information this Application collects automatically is # number of installs, and crash reports (both provided through Google Play Services).

We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
 

## What are my opt-out rights?

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. 
 

## Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information

We will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. We will retain Automatically Collected information for up to 24 months and thereafter may store it in aggregate. Please note that some or all of the User Provided Data may be required in order for the Application to function properly.


## Children
