<string name="explanatory"><b>Enter a probability</b> (between 0 and 1) or an 
arithmetic expression that evaluates to a probability and press 
<i>Expectorize</i>. A subset of the numbers 1-20 will light up such that any given 
number will be lit up with the given probability.\n\n

<b>Our favorite use for this:</b> Say you owe me $7 for lunch but only have a
twenty. If you give me the twenty with probability 7/20 then in expectation
you\'ve paid me $7! So type in <b>7/20</b> and tell me to pick a number from 1
to 20. Hit <i>Expectorize</i> -- or have me do it so I know you didn\'t cheat -- 
and if my number is lit up then I lucked out and get the $20. (If you trust 
Expectorant to randomize properly (you can, we promise) then you can just always 
choose <b>1</b>, or any number.)\n\n

<b>Advanced feature:</b> Entering something like <b>7@5,20</b> is a shortcut for
<b>(7-5)/(20-5)</b>. That\'s the probability p such that (1-p)*5 + p*20 = 7. 
WTF? Here\'s TF: If you have a five and a twenty and owe me $7, then give me the 
twenty with that probability and the five otherwise. Exquisitely fair (in 
expectation)!\n\n

<b>Stochastic nerdtastic restaurant bill splitting:</b> Say the subtotal is $100
and the items on the bill are $5, $25, $60, and $10. Enter <b>100:5</b> and have
the person who ordered the $5 item pick a number from 1 to 20. If their number 
is lit up (a 5% chance) they get to pay the whole bill! If not, amend the 
expression as <b>100:5,25</b> and repeat for the person who got the $25 item. 
They\'ll \"win\" with probability 25/(100-5). If they\'re off the hook, amend 
again to <b>100:5,25,60</b>. This time most likely -- p = 60/(100-5-25) -- the 
$60 person will win the honor of paying the bill. If not, notice that 
<b>100:5,25,60,10</b> yields 10/(100-5-25-60) = 1. So if the process makes it to
the last item on the bill then whoever got that item is it. Mathemagically, it 
doesn\'t matter what order you put the items in -- each person \"wins\" (pays 
the whole bill) with probability equal to their own fair share of the bill. In 
other words, you pay in expectation exactly your fair share. Including tax and 
tip, even though we never entered those. Pretty slick! Speaking of tips, you can 
minimize the hassle by starting with the most expensive items. Then you don\'t 
have to figure out who most of the items belong to. Oh, and if 3 people split 
the $10 pickled monkey balls just treat it as 3 items, $10/3 each (expressions 
instead of numbers are allowed).\n\n

NB: The ingenious restaurant bill splitting algorithm was devised by Dave 
Pennock of, appropriately, oddhead.com.</string>
